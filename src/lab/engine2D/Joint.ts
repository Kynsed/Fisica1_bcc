/** A Joint connects two RigidBodys by generating RigidBodyCollisions which are
used to find contact forces or collision impulses so that the attachment points on the
two RigidBodys are kept aligned together.

The {@link addCollision} method is where the ***collisions are generated***; that
method is called from
{@link lab/engine2D/ContactSim.ContactSim.findCollisions | ContactSim.findCollisions}.
The RigidBodyCollision generated for a Joint functions as both a collision and a
contact.

Joints are ***immutable***: they cannot be changed after they are constructed.

When two RigidBodys are connected by a Joint,
the two bodies are set to ***not collide*** with each other
via {@link RigidBody.addNonCollide}.

The ***order of the bodies*** in the Joint is important because {@link align}
moves the *second body* to align with first body (unless the second body is immoveable
because it has infinite mass).

The ***normal vector*** provided when making a Joint specifies the direction along which
the Joint operates. ContactSim calculates forces to keep the acceleration in the normal
direction at zero between the two attachment points of the Joint.

A ***single joint*** by itself will give a 'sliding track' type of connection. The
attachment points must have zero distance between them as measured in the direction of
the normal for the Joint, but in the direction perpendicular to the normal the
attachment points are free to move. See CartPendulum2 for an example.

A ***double joint*** consists of two Joints at the same location (same attachment
points) with perpendicular normal directions. A double joint is needed to keep the
attachment points aligned together.

Over time ***slippage*** of a Joint can occur, especially when there is fast rotation of
the bodies. The ***tightness*** of a Joint is measured by how close to zero is the
distance between the two attachment points. See {@link getNormalDistance}.

To attach to a ***fixed position in space*** use the
{@link lab/engine2D/Scrim.Scrim | Scrim} object. Or attach to an immoveable (infinite
mass) Polygon.

The two attachment points can be widely separated in 'single joints',
see CartPendulum2 for an example.

Another name for a joint is a *bilateral contact point* meaning that it can both push
and pull. This is different from ordinary contact points between bodies which can only
push against each other.

### Specifying a Joint's Normal Vector

When specifying a normal, we also specify the {@link CoordType},
which is either world coordinates or body coordinates. There are two cases:

+ `CoordType.WORLD` the normal is in world coordinates and is fixed.

+ `CoordType.BODY` The normal is calculated in the body coordinates of the *second*
RigidBody of the Joint, and rotates along with that body.

(need to convert from Java) ***TO BE DONE*** To make a Joint with a NumericalPath use
  PathJoint. In that case it is the NumericalPath that determines the normal.

### Aligning Joints

The {@link align} method aligns the RigidBodys connected by this Joint. Moves the
second body to align with the first body (unless the second body has infinite mass, in
which case the first body is aligned to the second). The second body is moved so that
its attach point is at same position as the first body's attach point. The angle of the
second body is not changed.

### Implementation Note: Separate Impact Points

Each side of the Joint has its own impact point and `R` vector; these are `impact,
impact2, R` and `R2`. We figure the impact point on each body according to where the
attachment point is on that body, by doing a `bodyToWorld` translation to find the
current location.

Previously we calculated the impact point only for `body1` of the joint and
then used that world location to calculate the `R2` for the normal body. It seems
that gives worse results, as shown by the 'two-connected-blocks' test where two blocks
are connected rigidly by 2 double joints. When the two-connected-blocks is spun quickly,
the joints slip significantly if we use the impact point of `body1` to define
where the joint is on `body2`.

**TO DO** should there be an option to have the normal attached to body1 instead of
body2? It is confusing now because the 'body coords normal' is attached to body2 if it
exists, otherwise it is attached to body1. This probably is because of how
RigidBodyCollision follows this policy.
