/** Physics engine for rigid bodies with contact forces to allow resting contact. The
contact forces prevent the bodies from interpenetrating when they are in resting
contact. Resting contact means the bodies are not colliding, but have edges and corners
that are in continuous contact and exerting force on each other.

The overall idea is to calculate the exact amount of force needed to *just barely*
prevent the objects from penetrating. These contact forces are calculated in the
{@link evaluate} method, which is called by the
{@link lab/model/DiffEqSolver.DiffEqSolver | DiffEqSolver} at the request of the
{@link lab/model/AdvanceStrategy.AdvanceStrategy | AdvanceStrategy} to advance the
state of the simulation.

Neumann for modifications to contact forces when curved edges are involved.

## Find External Forces

Within `evaluate()` we first let the super-class apply the external forces to the
RigidBody objects. The external forces include things like gravity, thrust, springs,
damping. The external forces result in accelerations of the bodies, so at this point
many of the bodies would start to penetrate into each other if we did not find contact
forces to prevent that.

## Find Contacts

Next in `evaluate()` we call `findCollisions()` to find all the contact points, and
possibly collisions as well. If we find any actual (penetrating) collisions, then
`evaluate()` returns the set of collisions found, which should then be handled before
trying to step forward again, see {@link ImpulseSim}.

The criteria for finding a contact is:

+ the corner (or edge) of one body must be *very close* to the edge of the other body,
as specified by `getDistanceTol()`.

+ the bodies must be *moving very slowly* relative to each other (the normal velocity)
at the contact point, as specified by `getVelocityTol()`.

The `evaluate()` method optionally finds independent subsets of collisions, because that
can make the compute_forces algorithm, which is `O(n^4)`, run faster in some cases. See
the flag {@link SUBSET_COLLISIONS}. Collisions are independent when there is
no chain of moveable (finite mass) bodies in common between the collisions.

## The Matrix Equation for Contact Forces

Now we have the set of contacts and we know the accelerations of the bodies due to
external forces. We set up a matrix equation
```text
a = A f + b
```
where

+ `a =` vector of accelerations
+ `A =` matrix describing how the `j`-th contact force affects the acceleration of
    the `i`-th *contact distance* (the separation between the bodies)
+ `f =` vector of contact forces (to be found)
+ `b =` external forces (gravity, thrust, rubber band, damping)

## Set Up the A Matrix

Here is how to set up the `A` matrix: For each contact distance `d_i`, find how the
acceleration of that contact distance `d_i''` is related to the force at the `j`-th
contact point. The force at the `j`-th contact point is `f_j N_j`, where `f_j` is a
scalar and `N_j` is the vector normal. The `a_ij` entry in the `A` matrix tells what
that relationship is between `f_j` and `d_i''`. This `a_ij` value is dependent only on
the current geometry of how the objects are oriented and touching each other.

<img src="../Baraff_Figure26.png" alt="Baraff Figure 26" />

For example, consider Figure 26 of
[Baraffs Siggraph 97 Course Notes(../Baraff_Siggraph_97_Course_Notes.pdf)
shown above. The figure shows two bodies
(B,C) resting on the ground, and a third body (A) resting on top of the other two. There
are 5 points of contact among the bodies and the ground. Here is how the matrix
equation would look for this situation:
```text
a1     a11  a12  a13   0    0     f1     b1
a2     a21  a22  a23   0    0     f2     b2
a3  =  a31  a32  a33  a34   0  *  f3  +  b3
a4      0    0   a43  a44  a45    f4     b4
a5      0    0    0   a54  a55    f5     b5
```
Consider the first contact at `p1` which is between the ground and body B. The
acceleration of the contact distance at `p1` is affected by the forces at `p1`, `p2`,
and `p3` because all of those forces affect the movement of body B. But the forces at
`p4` and `p5` have no effect, so their entries are zero in the first row of the `A`
matrix.

The first row of the matrix equation can be written out as
```text
a1 = a11*f1 + a12*f2 + a13*f3 + 0*f4 + 0*f5 + b1
```
That equation says the acceleration of contact distance at point `p1` is equal to a
certain linear combination of the contact forces `f1`, `f2`, `f3`, plus the acceleration
due to the external forces which is `b1`.

The particular values for `a11, a12, a13` are dependent on the geometry of the
situation: where the forces `f1`, `f2`, `f3` are applied on the body; in what direction
do the forces act; where is the center of mass of the body; how the force causes the
body to accelerate and spin; where is the point `p1` is in relation to the center of
mass; etc.

The third contact at `p3` is more complicated because it is affected by any forces
acting on body A or body B. These include all the forces except `f5`. Therefore the
third row of the `A` matrix has four non-zero entries corresponding to the four forces
that affect the acceleration at `p3`.

## Constraints On the Solution

Assume we now have the `b` vector of external forces and the `A` matrix of dependencies
between contact forces and resulting accelerations of different bodies. We solve for the
`f` vector of contact forces subject to the following constraints:
```text
a >= 0
f >= 0
a.f = 0
```
The constraints in words are:

+ `a >= 0`  we require all the relative normal accelerations (between bodies
at contact points) to be either zero (remain in contact) or positive (separating).

+ `f >= 0`  We require contact forces to be zero or positive because they can
only push, not pull.

+ `a.f = 0`  The third constraint is a math way of saying that
if there is a force, then acceleration is zero OR
if there is acceleration (separation), then there is no force.

Note that for Joints the constraints are different:

+ `a == 0`  a Joint always remains in resting contact, it never separates

+ No constraint on `f` because it can push or pull.

## Solving For the Contact Forces

The [Baraff 'Fast Contact Force' paper(../Baraff_Fast_Contact_Force_94.pdf) goes into full
detail about the algorithm to solve this constraint problem.  Here is a quick summary:

+ Start by setting all the forces to zero

+ Add in one force at a time, just enough to maintain the constraints on the points that
have been considered so far (ignoring the others), and readjust the other forces as
necessary.

+ Continue adding one force at a time, ignoring points that haven't been considered yet.

Suppose that we are working on adding in the third force after already finding the
forces for points 1 and 2. The trick is that we only look at the constraints on the
first 3 contact points, we ignore the other contact points and other forces. Once we've
found the 3rd force (and rebalanced forces 1 and 2 as needed) we then move on to
consider the 4th force.

The last step is to **apply the contact forces** to the bodies, which gives the final
set of accelerations that the `evaluate()` method then returns to the differential
equation solver.

## Extra Acceleration

The contact forces are calculated so that there is zero acceleration at contact points;
but this does not immediately affect the remaining small velocity at a contact point.
As a result, objects that are in resting contact will often have some undesirable
jittery motion.

One way to deal with this is to request a small amount of additional acceleration which
will eliminate that velocity over a few time steps. If the objects are moving towards
each other (a small negative velocity) we request a little more acceleration which
leads to a little more force being applied there. If the objects are moving apart (a
small positive velocity) we request a little less acceleration.

The extra acceleration is added to the `b` vector in the private method
`calculate_b_vector`. See {@link ExtraAccel} enum for
explanations of the various options. See {@link setExtraAccel} for how to
specify the desired ExtraAccel option.

## Intermediate Steps During evaluate()

A DiffEqSolver works by 'averaging' several calculated states for each time step; for
example ModifiedEuler averages 2 states, and RungeKutta averages 4 states. The collision
detection done in `evaluate()` is based on those intermediate states within a step of
the DiffEqSolver, so it is arguable whether that state actually ever occurs.

This point of view argues for only using the collisions detected between full steps of
the DiffEqSolver. However, contacts can come and go during these sub-steps so it seems
in practice to be more accurate to find the set of contacts anew in each call to
`evaluate()`. Also if a penetrating collision is detected we need to stop the process
and handle that collision instead, so it is important to do collision detection for that
as well.

Prior to February 2012, there was an experimental option specified by the flag
`REUSE_COLLISIONS` for which we did *not* find the collisions anew in the `evaluate()`
method, instead we used the collisions found outside the `evaluate()` method during
`AdvanceStrategy.advance()` which are based on a complete ODE step. See the git archive.

## Old Notes -- Do Not Trust

(Sept 2015: don't trust these old notes!)

New extra acceleration calculation (March 2, 2012). See note below from Nov 2014
about a modification of this calculation.
```text
let x be the joint gap.  xâ€™ = v, xâ€™â€™ = a.
Integrating:  xâ€™ = a t + v_0;   x = a t^2/2 + v_0 t + x_0
ideally we find accel that both stops velocity and brings the gap to zero:
0 = a h^2/2 + v_0 h + x_0
0 = a h + v_0
we canâ€™t satisfy both those equations, but we can maybe find something
in the middle?
we know h, need to find a.
a = -(v_0 h + x_0)2/h^2
a = -v_0/h
what is the average of these?
-(2 v_0 h + x_0) /h^2
(note that we put the opposite of this into b vector)
```

I tested the relationship between the time step `h` and the divisor `q` used in
finding the extra acceleration `a`, where `a = v / q`. (This was October 2011). I
found that instability occurs when `h > 2 q` for Runge Kutta solver, and when `h > q`
for modified Euler solver. This makes sense because RK averages 4 sub-steps and in a
sense the time step used is actually `h/2`. Whereas modified Euler averages 2
sub-steps that are `h` apart. It also makes sense because the integral above is over a
single time step `h`, so if you are integrating over significantly longer time then
you would overshoot and the velocity would be reduced too much.

Extra acceleration and reusing collisions: It would make more sense to take the
velocity at the start of the RK step and use that starting velocity value to
calculate an extra acceleration that is used for all the sub-steps of the RK step.
Then you would wind up reducing the velocity to zero over that time step. Instead,
what we do currently is recalculate the extra acceleration in each sub-step, based
on the current simulation state (velocity) in that sub-step. This seems to be less
effective in reducing the velocity -- it takes more steps to get to zero velocity.
However, I tried an experiment (October 2011) that didn't work out so well. I tried
to reuse the collisions, so that the same collision is used for all the RK sub-steps
and so have the same velocity used in each sub-step. The results were inconsistent,
and re-using the collisions has other effects.

Note about joints:  from doing a quick test with DoublePendulumCompareBuilder
it seems that you can get almost as good results for joints by turning off the
'generate tiny collisions at each step' code in CollisionSim and turning on the
'extra acceleration to eliminate velocity' code here for joints.  This might be
useful if you want to avoid the extra work in each step for handling those tiny
collisions.  As long as we do the 'tiny collisions for joints', we ensure that
velocity at joints is zero, and therefore don't need to do the "extra acceleration
to eliminate velocity" kluge for joints.

/** Applies a normal force at the contact point. Result is modification of the rigid
body accelerations in the change vector. Also the Force objects are added to the SimList
for display purposes when the 'show forces' flag is on.

The impact point(s) given in the contact only affect the angular acceleration of
the objects, not the linear acceleration. Curiously, the impact point can be anywhere
along the line normal to the impact point with the same result. Because the angular
acceleration changes by the cross product of the force and the vector from center of
mass to impact point: `R x F`. If you change `R` by adding a multiple `n` of `F`
there is no change: `(R + n F) x F = R x F + n F x F = R x F + 0`. This is
why it doesn't matter which side of the gap that we assign the impact point for the
collision.

We use `R` vector here, not `U` vector. The force is applied at the point of contact,
not at the center of the circle for a circular edge. The `U` vector is used for
calculating the velocity of the gap distance -- which went into the `b`-vector, and
therefore determined the amount of force. The `U` vector is also used for calculating
the `A` matrix. We could use the `U` vector here, but it would give the same result
because `U = R + n F`, see the section *Equivalence of Using R or U Vector For Normal
Velocity* in {@link RigidBodyCollision}.

We entirely skip making (and therefore displaying) the forces for a fixed (infinite
mass) body. The reason is that those forces won't affect the simulation because the
fixed body cannot move. We could let those forces thru if desired.

/** Find subsets of related contacts to solve each subset separately for contact forces.
This feature is useful for cases where there are a lot of contacts that are in separate
groups (two piles) because the matrices being solved are smaller. The ComputeForces
algorithm is `O(n^4)`. For example suppose there are 40 contact points. The cost of
`40^4 = 2,560,000` is far greater than `20^4 + 20^4 = 320,000`. There is some overhead
to finding the subsets, so this can lose time when there is just a big single pile.
