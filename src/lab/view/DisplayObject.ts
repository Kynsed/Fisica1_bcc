/** An object that can be displayed in a {@link lab/view/SimView.SimView | SimView},
often it is the visible representation of a {@link SimObject}.
The SimView determines the simulation coordinates and
{@link CoordMap} which are used to place the object on the screen.

Each DisplayObject has a default policy about when the SimObject it represents is
dragable; this can be overridden via the {@link setDragable} method.

Many DisplayObjects allow specifying a **prototype** DisplayObject. When a display
property is `undefined`, then the property is fetched from the prototype. If it is also
`undefined` on the prototype then a default value is used.

See the View section of [myPhysicsLab Architecture](../Architecture.html#view) for more
about how DisplayObjects are used within an application.
