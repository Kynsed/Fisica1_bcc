/** Manages an HTML canvas and contains a list of {@link SimView}'s which are drawn
into the canvas. The SimViews are drawn overlapping so that the last SimView appears on
top of the others.

### Canvas Size

The HTML canvas has a specified width and height, which determines
the *screen rectangle* of the canvas. The canvas screen rectangle has `(0, 0)` for
the top-left corner and `(width, height)` for the bottom-right corner. The vertical
coordinates increase downwards.

The size can be changed via {@link setWidth}, {@link setHeight},
{@link setSize} or {@link setScreenRect}. When the size of the HTML canvas changes,
the SimViews are set to have the same screen rectangle as the canvas.

Each SimView has a simulation rectangle and a screen rectangle, and these are aligned
by a {@link CoordMap}. The simulation rectangle specifies the simulation coordinates,
and the CoordMap translates simulation coordinates to screen coordinates. Pan and zoom
can be accomplished by changing the simulation rectangle of a SimView (which changes
its CoordMap accordingly).

<a id="focusview"></a>
### Focus View

The {@link LabCanvas#getFocusView focus view} is the SimView that the user expects to
modify by his/her actions. For example,
{@link lab/app/SimController.SimController | SimController} will pan the focus SimView
when a particular set of modifier keys are pressed during a mouse drag.

The first SimView that is added becomes the initial focus view, but the focus view can
be changed via {@link setFocusView}.

### Background Color

Whenever {@link paint} is called to draw a new frame, the first step is to clear the
old frame from the HTML canvas. What happens depends on the
{@link LabCanvas#getBackground background color}.

+ If no background color is specified then we use JavaScript `canvas.clearRect()`
    which clears to transparent black pixels.

+ If a background color is specified, then we use JavaScript `canvas.fillRect()`
    which fills the HTML canvas with that color.

The background color can be set with {@link setBackground}.

### Trails Effect

A visual effect where moving objects leave behind a smeared out trail can be done by
setting the background color and the *alpha transparency*, see {@link setAlpha}.
Here are example settings, which can be done in a
{@link lab/util/Terminal.Terminal | Terminal} session:
```
simCanvas.setBackground('black');
simCanvas.setAlpha(0.05);
```

When `alpha` is 1.0 then there is no trails effect because the old frame is entirely
painted over with an opaque color.

The trails effect happens when `alpha` is less than 1 because we paint a translucent
rectangle over the old frame, which gradually makes the old image disappear after
several iterations of painting.

### Draw Only When There Are Changes

LabCanvas avoids unnecessary drawing (for example when the simulation is paused).
It does this by asking each of its SimViews whether they have changed, via
{@link SimView.getChanged}. The SimView similarly asks each of its DisplayObjects
via {@link DisplayObject.getChanged}. If there are no changes, then LabCanvas
avoids drawing.

Note that the `getChanged` methods on the various display objects have a side-effect:
they reset their state to "unchanged". Be sure that all the `getChanged` methods are
called on all objects in the display hierarchy, otherwise there may be a leftover
"changed" flag that was not cleared.



Parameters Created
------------------

+ ParameterNumber named `WIDTH`, see {@link setWidth}

+ ParameterNumber named `HEIGHT`, see {@link setHeight}

+ ParameterNumber named `ALPHA`, see {@link setAlpha}

+ ParameterString named `BACKGROUND`, see {@link setBackground}

Events Broadcast
----------------
All the Parameters are broadcast when their values change.  In addition:

+ GenericEvent named `VIEW_ADDED`; the value is the SimView being added

+ GenericEvent named `VIEW_REMOVED`; the value is the SimView being removed

+ GenericEvent named `FOCUS_VIEW_CHANGED`; the value is the SimView which is
    the focus, or `null` if there is no focus view

+ GenericEvent named `VIEW_LIST_MODIFIED`

+ GenericEvent named `SIZE_CHANGED`
