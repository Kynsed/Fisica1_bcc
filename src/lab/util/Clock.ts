// *************************** Clock **************************

/** Advances along with real time when active, and can execute tasks at appointed
times. There are commands to pause, resume, and single-step the Clock, as well as set
its time and speed relative to system time. Clock has a list of
{@link ClockTask}s which it causes to be executed at the times
specified by the ClockTasks. Clock has a parallel *real time clock* for measuring
performance.

Clock time is used by a **client** object such as
{@link lab/app/SimRunner.SimRunner | SimRunner}
to know *how much to advance a simulation*.
This is how
operations on Clock like pause, single-step, setting time rate, etc. affect the display
of the Simulation. (When clock time is in the past, such as at time zero, then the
client can restart the simulation from initial conditions.)

While a *unit of simulation time* can be interpreted to mean anything from
a millisecond to a millenium, we use the Clock to advance the Simulation time along
with real time as though each unit of time is equal to one second of real time.

<a id="typesoftime"></a>
## Types of Time

There are several types of time considered here: system time, clock time, simulation
time, and real time. All of these are measured in seconds, though simulation time might
have a different meaning – see
[About Units Of Measurement](../Architecture.html#aboutunitsofmeasurement).

+ **System Time** is given by {@link SystemClock.systemTime}.
System time is the basis of
the other time measurements. For example, clock time and real time each have a "system
start time" by which they are measured. System time is always running.

<a id="clocktime"></a>
+ **Clock Time** is given by {@link getTime}.
Clock time advances at the current {@link Clock#getTimeRate time rate}
(multiple of system
time). Clock time can be modified directly by calling {@link setTime}. Clock time can
be {@link Clock#pause paused} or {@link Clock#resume resumed}.

+ **Simulation Time** is given by
{@link lab/model/Simulation.Simulation.getTime | Simulation.getTime}.
Simulation time is advanced by the client, usually to keep up with clock time. When
performance problems occur, the clock time can be retarded via {@link setTime} to
match the current simulation time.

<a id="md:realtime"></a>
+ **Real Time** is given by {@link getRealTime}. Closely related to clock time,
real time is used to measure performance: how much the simulation time
has slipped behind real time because the simulation couldn't compute
quickly enough. Real time usually mirrors clock time – they are paused or resumed
together and have the same time rate relative to system time – but real time is not
affected by {@link setTime}. When performance problems happen the usual result is
that clock time is retarded to match simulation time by setting clock time to an
earlier value. In this case, real time is unaffected and will be ahead of clock time by
the amount of time lost to performance problems.


## ClockTask

A {@link ClockTask} contains a function which is to be executed at a particular time.
The time is expressed in *clock time*.

ClockTasks are scheduled as a side effect of Clock methods such as
`setTime()`, `resume()`, `addTask()`. ClockTasks are cancelled as a side
effect of Clock methods such as `pause()`, `removeTask()`.

A typical use of ClockTask is to restart the simulation after a few seconds, which
makes the simulation repeatedly "loop" showing it's first few seconds.


## Step Mode

The {@link step} method puts the Clock into a special *step mode*. Clients should
check for this step mode by calling {@link isStepping}. Step mode being `true`
means that *clock time has advanced even though the clock is paused*. The client should
update the simulation to match the new clock time, and then call
{@link clearStepMode} to indicate that it has advanced the simulation.


Parameters Created
------------------

+ ParameterNumber named `TIME_RATE`, see {@link setTimeRate}


Events Broadcast
----------------
All the Parameters are broadcast when their values change.  In addition:

+ GenericEvent named `CLOCK_PAUSE`, see {@link pause}

+ GenericEvent named `CLOCK_RESUME`, see {@link resume}

+ GenericEvent named `CLOCK_STEP`, see {@link step}

+ GenericEvent named `CLOCK_SET_TIME`, see {@link setTime}


**TO DO** Should be able to have clock time (and therefore simulation time) start at
something other than zero.
