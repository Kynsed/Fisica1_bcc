// ************************ MemoList *******************************

/** A {@link Memorizable} object that keeps a list of other Memorizable objects and
frequently tells them to `memorize` simulation data. The `memorize` method is meant to
be called after each simulation time step, as is done in
{@link lab/model/AdvanceStrategy.AdvanceStrategy.advance | AdvanceStrategy.advance}.

This is an example of
[Composite design pattern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Composite_pattern): it is a
tree structure where every node on the tree defines the `memorize` method and calls that
method on its sub-nodes.

The base of the tree structure is usually
{@link lab/app/SimRunner.SimRunner | SimRunner}.
You can add a Memorizable directly to SimRunner using {@link MemoList.addMemo}.
Or you can add a Memorizable to one of the branches of the tree, such as a
{@link lab/view/LabCanvas.LabCanvas | LabCanvas} contained in the SimRunner, or a
{@link lab/view/SimView.SimView | SimView} contained in the LabCanvas.

In a typical simulation, a graph is **periodically updated** because
{@link lab/app/SimRunner.SimRunner.callback | SimRunner.callback} causes the
{@link lab/model/AdvanceStrategy.AdvanceStrategy | AdvanceStrategy} to both
advance the simulation and also call `memorize` on each LabCanvas. The `memorize` of
the LabCanvas calls `memorize` on each SimView, which in turn calls `memorize` on any
Memorizable objects contained in the SimView, such as a
{@link lab/graph/GraphLine.GraphLine | GraphLine}.

// *********************** GenericMemo ********************************

/** A generic {@link Memorizable} object that calls a JavaScript function.

Example 1
---------
Make a GenericMemo that prints the angle variable of a simulation
into the {@link lab/util/Terminal.Terminal | Terminal} output area.
Here `simRun` is an instance of {@link lab/app/SimRunner.SimRunner | SimRunner}.
```
var angle = sim.getVarsList().getVariable('ANGLE');
var memo = new GenericMemo(()=> println('angle: '+angle.getValue()));
simRun.addMemo(memo);
```
This code can be entered as Terminal commands in
[Pendulum](https://www.myphysicslab.com/pendulum/pendulum-en.html?show-terminal=true).

Use the following to turn off the GenericMemo:
```
simRun.removeMemo(memo);
```

Example 2
---------
This sets the color of a spring depending on how much it is stretched.
```
var spring = simList.get('spring1');
var dispSpring = displayList.findSpring(spring);
var memo = new GenericMemo(function() {
  var stretch = Math.max(Math.min(spring.getStretch(), 1), -1);
  if (stretch < 0) {
    dispSpring.setColorCompressed(Util.colorString3(-stretch, 0, 0));
  } else {
    dispSpring.setColorExpanded(Util.colorString3(0, stretch, 0));
  }
});
simRun.addMemo(memo);
```
This script can be entered as Terminal commands in
[Cart + Pendulum with Physics Engine](https://www.myphysicslab.com/engine2D/cart-pendulum-en.html?show-terminal=true).

Example 3
---------
This stops a simulation after 2 seconds. Clicking the "play" button will then continue
the simulation, because `once` has been set false. To re-enable the behavior, set
`once` to true.
```
var once = true;
var memo = new GenericMemo(function(){
    if (once && sim.getTime()>2)
      {once=false;simRun.pause()}
});
simRun.addMemo(memo);
```
This script can be entered as Terminal commands in any simulation.
