# Preprocess html files by doing macro substitutions (similar to C preprocessor) to
# transform text within the file, writing a new html file.
#
# @param {string} file = source file name, example: src/sims/mechanics/Spring1App.html
#
# @param {string} target = output file, example: build/sims/mechanics/Spring1App-en.html
#        The suffix determines the value of the #LOCALE macro.  For example
#        #LOCALE would be "en" for "Spring1App-en.html".  Default locale is "en"
#        when there is no suffix.
#
# @param {string} orderFile = file containing list of files for next/previous links,
#        (or empty string). Available in #NEXT_LINK, #PREV_LINK macros.
#
#
# ------------ #define ----------------
#
# The macro definitions are roughly similar to the C preprocessor.
#
# #define makes a simple text replacement macro. It causes a 'token' to be replaced
# with some text.  Example:
#
#     #define L1  L<sub>1</sub>
#
# After this is defined, anytime we see the text L1 (as a separate word) then it
# is replaced by L<sub>1</sub>.
#
# It is legal to define a macro that expands to nothing:
#
#     #define FOO
#
# The # character can be used to delimit macro tokens: for example #L1, L1#, or #L1#
# will all be expanded into the same result.
#
# In a #define statement: WHEN THE MACRO TOKEN BEGINS WITH A #, THEN THE # IS REQUIRED.
# For example if the macro definition is
#
#     #define #L1  L<sub>1</sub>
#
# Then only the tokens #L1 and #L1# will be replaced.
# Requiring the leading # is recommended for making macros more visible to the reader
# of the code.
#
# Multi-line definitions use backslash '\' as line continuation. Note that unlike in
# the C preprocessor, we retain the newline in the definition.
#
# All macro definitions create perl regexp substitution rules. For example
#
#     #define L1  L<sub>1</sub>
#
# becomes
#
#     s~#?\bL1\b#?~L<sub>1</sub>~
#
# A #define cannot contain a ~ character because ~ is the regexp delimiter.
#
# The 'token' of the definition is stored along with the regexp substitution rule.
# The token does not include the leading #.
# If another #define occurs with the same token, then the previous #define
# is deleted.
#
#
# ------------ #rule ----------------
#
# #rule defines a raw perl substitution rule. It operates on the perl variable $_ which
# holds the current line being processed.
# Here is an example which replaces "sub(foo)" by "<sub>foo</sub>"
#
#     #rule s~#?\bsub\b#?\((.+?)\)~<sub>$1</sub>~
#
# By using a regular expression, a rule like this can appear to take multiple arguments.
# The replacement expression can include variables defined in this program such as
# $LOCALE, $targetName, $fileName.
#
# Rules have an empty string for their 'token', so they are never replaced and
# cannot be undefined.
#
#
# ------------ #defineFrom ----------------
#
# #defineFrom creates a #define rule by evaluating a regexp on some existing text.
# The text is first processed with any rules defined at the time, and then the
# regexp is applied to the processed text. The resulting text becomes the value
# for the rule that is created, similar to how #define works.
#
#      #defineFrom token {text} regexp
#
# Here is an example.
#
#     #define #APP_PATH sims.pendulum.DoublePendulumApp
#     #defineFrom #FILE_PATH {#APP_PATH} s~\.~/~g
#
# Then #FILE_PATH will evaluate to sims/pendulum/DoublePendulumApp.
#
# A #defineFrom must be on a single line.
#
#
# ------------ #mathDefine, #mathRule, #mathOn, #mathOff ---------
#
# These are similar to #define and #rule, except these rules are only active
# when "math mode" is on.  You turn math mode on or off by calling #mathOn
# or #mathOff.
#
# The idea is to make a set of rules for writing math as HTML, using tags like
# <sub>, <sup>, etc.  Turning math mode on or off ensures these rules will not
# affect anything other than these HTML math expressions.
# For example, these HTML-macro rules must not modify any LaTeX expressions
# on the same page when using MathJaX.
#
# The #mathOn and #mathOff directives can be included in other macros.
# For example, here are definitions to surround some HTML with both a special
# HTML <p> tag and also the #mathOn, #mathOff directives.
#
#     #define #eqn_start #mathOn \
#     <p class="display-equation">
#
#     #define #eqn_end </p> \
#     #mathOff
#
# Note that the embedded newlines (indicated by trailing slash at end of line)
# are required, because the #mathOn, #mathOff directives only work when they
# are at the beginning of a line (also, the rest of the line after #mathOn
# is discarded).
#
#
# ------------ #variable  ----------------
#
# #variable is a shortcut version of #mathDefine.  The following are equivalent
#
#     #variable _x  x
#     #mathDefine _x  <i>x</i>
#
#
# ------------ #undefine  ----------------
#
# Use #undefine TOKEN to delete a #define, #mathDefine, or #variable.
# Any rule that has a "token" name can be deleted.  The token can be preceded
# by a # or not, both ways will work:
#
#     #undefine #L1
#     #undefine L1
#
#
# ------------- #include -----------------------
#
# To include another file:
#
#     #include "macros.html"
#
# The included file can contain macro (rule) definitions or regular text content.
#
# Macro rules are applied to the name of the include file. This makes it possible to
# include different files depending on variables like #LOCALE.
# For example:
#
#     #include "macros-#LOCALE.html"
#
# Would include the file "macros-de.html" when #LOCALE is "de".
#
#
# ------------- #comment -----------------------
#
# Comments are written as:
#
#     #comment  This is a comment.
#
# Comments must appear at the start of a line, but can have whitespace at front.
# Comments can be put inside of a multi-line macro definition, they are eliminated
# when processed.
#
# ------------- #macrosOn, #macrosOff -----------------------
#
# These commands turn macro processing on or off.  When macro processing is off
# we still process macro keywords (#define, etc.) but do not apply the set of
# macro rules to do text replacement.
#
#
# ---------- Pre-Defined Macros ------------------
#
# These macros are automatically created.
#
# #FILE_NAME gives the file name being processed without the type suffix.
#
# #BASE_NAME gives the file name being processed without locale suffix or
# file type.
#
# #DATE_TIME gives the current date
#
# #LOCALE gives the two-letter ISO 639-1 locale (for example en, de) derived
# from suffix of the target file name (for example -en, -de).
# If target file doesn't end with a locale, then #LOCALE is empty string.
#
#
# ---------- Next/Previous Links ------------------
#
# The next/previous links are read from the orderFile (typically this is
# `src/index_order.txt`). We create the pre-defined macros
#
#     #NEXT_LINK
#     #PREV_LINK
#
# These are created by finding the name of the current file in the orderFile
# and getting the preceding and succeeding entries in the orderFile.
# See Overview.md section "HTML Example Files for Applications".
#
#
# ------------- Order Is Significant -------------------
#
# Later rules are executed first.
#
# When a rule (macro) is defined it is prepended to the list of rules.  Therefore
# rules are executed in reverse order of when they are defined:  the last rule
# defined is the first to be attempted.
#
# Also keep in mind that this program runs in a single pass.  So only the rules
# that have been defined so far are available to execute.  Rules defined later
# have no effect on earlier text in the file.
#
# When a new rule is defined with the same token, the previous rule is deleted.
# The token is the name provided in #define, #mathDefine, or #variable.
# (The leading # is not part of the token).
#
#
# ------------- First Line, Blank Lines, White Space -------------------
#
# We throw away newlines and spaces at the start of the file.
# This is to ensure that the HTML doctype declaration is on the first line.
#
# We throw away blank lines that occur after macro directives (#define, etc.).
# This helps to make the resulting HTML file look better by not having
# multiple blank lines where there were macro definitions in the source
# HTML file.
#
# Macro keyword directives (#define, etc.) can have leading white space,
# but nothing else can precede them on a line.
#
# User-defined (and pre-defined) macros can appear anywhere, even in quotes.
#
#
# -------------  Debugging  ---------------------
#
# Two levels of debugging, controlled by setting the $debug variable.
# Higher level includes lower level of debug messages.
#
# $debug = 1
# Prints key computed variables such as file name, locale, next and previous
# links, etc.
#
# $debug = 10
# Prints each line as it is read, shows how rules are applied, prints complete
# rules database at end. Each time a rule is applied, the resulting changed
# text is printed, until there are no more changes, and then you see the final
# output text.
#
#
# -------------  How It Works  ------------------
#
# We build up a set of "rules" (or "macros") which are Perl regexp substitution
# expressions stored as text strings in the @rules array.  Each entry in the
# @rules array is a "record" (Perl hash) consisting of three fields:
#
#    TOKEN (string) the unique name of the rule (can be empty string)
#    MATH  (boolean) if true then the rule only fires in #mathOn mode
#    RULE  (string) the regexp substitution expression
#
# Most rules are user-defined via keyword directives like #rule, #define,
# or #variable which are read from the file(s) being processed.  Some rules
# are pre-defined in this program.
#
# The #include keyword reads another file, which usually defines macros (rules)
# but could also just be regular content (which would be added in place).
#
# We begin by reading a line from the input file into the "buffer" which holds
# yet unprocessed text.
#
# We consider one line at a time from the buffer. Lines are separated by a newline
# character (\n). We remove the line from the buffer.
#
# We first check for the various keywords (such as #define, #include,
# #comment, #macrosOff, etc.) and take appropriate action if those are found
# at the start of a line (leading whitespace is ignored).
#
# If the line doesn't start with a keyword, we then go thru the list
# of rules (macros).  When we find that a rule matches and changes the line
# (possibly into multiple lines) we then prepend the changed line to the buffer
# and start over: taking the first line from the buffer and processing that line
# as described above.  This process can happen many times for a single line
# because a macro can be replaced by multiple lines which can contain other macros.
#
# If no keywords (#define, #include, #comment, etc.) were found at the start of the
# line and no user defined macro rules changed the line, then the line is finished.
# We write the line to the target file, and fetch a new line from the buffer (or
# from the input file if the buffer is empty).
#
# Note that checkNoRule() is called frequently in the code.  Here's why:  there may
# be a multi-line #rule or #define that is "open" -- in process of being created.
# Until we see a line that ends without a continuation backslash, we keep adding
# the text to the currently open definition. Therefore, whenever we recognize a new
# keyword, we check that there is not an open rule.
#
#
# -------------  To Do List  ------------------
#
# TO DO: allow #rule to have a token, so that a rule can be #undefined or replaced.
# TO DO: close file handles if an error occurs.
# TO DO: check #define for ~ char, and pick a different delimiter for the regexp.
# TO DO: add option to use different symbol for delimiter other than #
# TO DO: create #default statement: like a #define or #rule, except it adds the rule to
#        the end of the list instead of the start, so it only takes effect if the rule
#        has not been previously defined. (Would need another flag to avoid deleting
#        the rule since it would have same token).
# TO DO: add a -d flag for debugging
# TO DO: instead of the fourth argument being compiled, could define a general
#        argument to create a macro with any name:  -macro(COMPILE_OPTION=debug)
